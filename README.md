## Project Overview

This project analyzes 230,000+ Spotify tracks to uncover what makes a song popular.  
Key findings show that hit songs are typically more energetic, danceable, upbeat, and vocal-driven. However, audio features alone only moderately predict popularityâ€”artist reputation and external factors also play a significant role.
